# tortle card
These are all the files for my 16-bit GPU called the tortle card 200X3D

You can find the instructions to simulate it down below

Before you try it out, I recommend watching my youtube video first if you have no idea what you're doing

### Instructions:
1. Make sure you have Logisim Evolution installed.
2. Open pointplotter.py and replace the output file location to your preffered location. (make sure it is a .hex file)

3. Select which of the template shapes you want to render by uncommenting them or create your own.

4. Open the turtle card in Logisim Evolution, and make sure to import the output hex files A and B into the corresponding ROMs.

5. Go to the "Simulate" tab and make sure Auto-Tick is enabled, and is set to 2048.0 KHz.

7. Set your FOV to around 50-100 in binary form and turn the "2" on the switch above it on and off to clear the instruction counter and press the "1" to start rendering!
